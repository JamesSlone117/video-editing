    sleep 1
    ;Send ^+!d ;ctrl alt shift d  is [ripple delete]. I had disabled CTRL CHIFT D for some raisin. i guess I'll see why later.
    Send "w" ;ctrl  shift d  is also [ripple delete]. Premier 2024 wasn't working with the old shortcut, for some reason. Note there are two versions of it, and only one of them is explicitly for the timeline panel. That's the one that I think you're supposed to use now, but it's also finicky now, perhaps getting confused if it has another general assignment.
